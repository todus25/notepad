Sometimes they pay off and sometimes they don't. But what matters is that we've built an environment where any crazy idea you have can be the one that makes the company. If you're smart and hardworking, risks pay off more often than not.\n\nWe're here to build something big. The world needs native education and we're going to build it. In a year and a half, we've reached a few million students, created thousands of new teachers, and changed the way the world thinks about code.
